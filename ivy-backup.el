;;; Commentary:

;; This package lets you use ivy to control helm-backup

;; For options like ediff or open in new buffer, run `ivy-dispatching-done'
;; while running ivy-backup. By default this is bound to C-o

;;; Code:
(require 'ivy)
(require 'helm-backup)

;;;###autoload
(defun ivy-backup ()
  "Main function used to call `ivy-backup`."
  (interactive)
  (let ((helm-quit-if-no-candidate
         (lambda ()
           (error
            "No filename associated with buffer, file has no backup yet or filename is blacklisted"))))
    (ivy-read
     (format "Backup for %s" (buffer-file-name))
     (helm-backup--list-file-change-time (buffer-file-name))
     :action (lambda (candidate)
               (with-helm-current-buffer
                 (helm-backup--replace-current-buffer (cdr candidate) (buffer-file-name)))))))

(ivy-set-actions
 'ivy-backup
 '(("e" (lambda (candidate)
          (helm-backup--create-ediff (cdr candidate) (current-buffer))) "Ediff file with backup")
   ("f" (lambda (candidate)
          (helm-backup--open-in-new-buffer (cdr candidate) (buffer-file-name))) "Open in new buffer")))

(provide 'ivy-backup)
