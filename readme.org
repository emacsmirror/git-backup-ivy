* Installation
Read [[https://github.com/antham/git-backup][git-backup]] for dependencies.


To make git-backup auto-backup the current file every time you save you can add this to your config:
#+begin_example
(require 'git-backup-ivy)
(add-hook 'after-save-hook '(lambda () (git-backup-version-file git-backup-ivy-git-path git-backup-ivy-backup-path nil (buffer-file-name))))
#+end_example

* Instructions
Run ~M-x git-backup-ivy~.
For options like ~ediff~ or open in new buffer, run ~ivy-dispatching-done~ while ivy is open. By default this is bound to C-o
